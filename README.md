# fcnpc-sampgdk

English | [PortuguÃªs](./README.pt.md)

---

Library that allows invoking [FCNPC plugin](https://github.com/ziggi/FCNPC) natives and callbacks from within a plugin that uses [sampgdk](https://github.com/Zeex/sampgdk).

To better understand how this works, also see [samp-streamer-plugin-sampgdk-invoke](https://github.com/IstuntmanI/samp-streamer-plugin-sampgdk-invoke), a similar library that allows invoking [Streamer plugin](https://github.com/samp-incognito/samp-streamer-plugin) instead.

## Requirements

* [FCNPC](https://github.com/ziggi/FCNPC) v2.0.4 or later
* [sampgdk](https://github.com/Zeex/sampgdk) amalgamation
* C++ compiler
